SCORING (0.0-1.0 numeric):
- CREATIVITY: Originality, fresh perspective, avoidance of cliches
- ENGAGEMENT: Hook, narrative momentum, readability

CHECKS (pass/fail boolean):
- TONE MATCH: Does it match the "${tone}" tone? (true = matches, false = doesn't match)
- WORD COUNT: Is it under ${WORD_LIMIT} words? (true = under limit, false = over limit)

WINNER SELECTION:
Balance creativity and engagement scores against the checks. Failed checks are significant penalties - a story that fails a check needs notably higher scores to compensate.

Provide scores/checks and brief reason for each provider, then declare an overall winner with reasoning.`;
